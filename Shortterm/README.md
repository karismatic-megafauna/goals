### Finish Coding Math series
I am on episode 9 out of 44. Working on making a website that I can publish
the coding examples to. Going to make it in ES6 with webpack and all the
modern goodies


### Do something with the Raspberry Pi
I ordered a Rasberry Pi, it should be here soon! It has a bunch of starter
projects in a book that should explain what it does. Probably going to use it
for something silly around the house


### Finish Bash Academy
Want to get better at bash scripting so I can have really killer dotfiles
and have a better grasp of a really useful tool. Have not started.

### Read [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
Almost done! On 'async and performance' so 4/6 have been read! Woo. Temporary
hiatus because it is too involved for me at this point. Looking forward to
finishing the series tho!

### Read "Search Inside Yourself"
Have not started

### Read "Mindful Work"
