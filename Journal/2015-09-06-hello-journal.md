#Hello Journal

Not sure what this is supposed to be, but I want to start writing in it
every day!

That would at least make me commit something each day. Maybe I can make that
a tmuxinator project! The tricky question is what to write about?

## Ideas

A morning post detailing what I want to learn today?
 - good because it would give me a todo list of sorts...
 - include my calendar digest 

A checklist of things to do!
  - some bool values like
    - [ ] morning physical workout -> shoot arrows/run/gym
    - [ ] morning mental workout -> kata/SQL Fiddle/Side Project
    - [ ] hours of sleep? (just fun to track), maybe say energy level at end of the day

A nightly post summarizing what I did today?
 - could be in tandem with a morning post? 

My only fear is that it will be too much work to keep up, so anything I can do
to make this more regular or automated is a good thing!

## Main Goal

I guess it is important to have a Mission Statement so here it goes!

> I want to have a morning routine that makes me a
> better person both physically and mentally
