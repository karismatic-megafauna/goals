# January

Started off the year with a bang at Dela's wedding!

Established some goals for personal growth; Trying out some robotics via
raspberry pi, want to contribute in some way to open source software possibly
cylon.js.

On a technical level I hope to be actually coding more and in a more meaningful
way. Actually finishing side projects like Coding Math or FlipperBot would be
good places to improve in realm.

Scale was an incredible conference to attend. Some really interesting talks
about embedded systems and one particularly cool one about the imposter
syndrome. I feel like I am capable, I just need to just do a lot of work and
stop wasting motion on things I don't want to do.

Some takeaways from this month have been:
Nothing to it but to do it
It's not as hard as you think it is
Practice mindfulness

Have some great books to read and this next month I am going to be focusing on
actually getting shit done, possibly more daily reflections here!
